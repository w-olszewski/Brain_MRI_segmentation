# Brain_MRI_segmentation
Automatic Brain MRI segmentation tool

A deep learning tool used for automatic segmentation of 3D brain MRI images. The algorithym uses a U-Net architecture and a small number of labeled training data (15 MRI scans) and implements various data augmentation techniques to increase generalizability of the model. 

A 2012 MICCAI challenge dataset has been used for training. Moreover the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) and the Child and Adolesent NeuroDevelopment Initiative (CANDI) datasets had been used to asses generalizability.
